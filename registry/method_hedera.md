### Hedera AnonCreds Method

The Hedera AnonCreds Method specification defines how AnonCreds objects should be registered and resolved through [Hedera DID Method](https://github.com/hashgraph/did-method/blob/master/hedera-did-method-specification.md). 

The specification leverages [HCS-1 standard](https://hashgraphonline.com/docs/standards/hcs-1/) for managing immutable files on [Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)](https://hedera.com/consensus-service).
In Hedera AnonCreds Method, all published AnonCreds objects except for RevRegEntry are treated as HCS-1 files (Schema, CredDef, RevRegDef).
